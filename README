This repository contains code that I've collected and adapted while exploring
the wonderful embedded world of AVR CMU's and many other components that can be
attached to it to form a complete embedded system.

Until further notice, all this code is targeted at the ATMEGA168/328 and the
ATMEGA1284p Accompanying information can be found at different pages on
http://christophe.vg/embedded

USAGE

The repository is meant to be put as a directory (subrepository) along side an
actual project. It contains a Makefile that can be re-used. With the following
directory structure your project files can be instrumented as follows:

my-project/
           moose
           main.c
           Makefile

main.c:

  #include "moose/avr.h"
  ...

Makefile:

  # additional modules to compile
  MORE_SRC = moose/avr.c moose/clock.c moose/sleep.c moose/serial.c moose/xbee.c

  # the target MCU and its speed
  MCU=atmega1284p
  F_CPU=8000000

  # which programmer to use
  AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER=jtag2

  # external hardware composition ... yummie :-)
  MORE_CDEFS=-DSERIAL_ON_USART1 # -DXBEE_ON_USART0 == default

  include moose/Makefile

  # to make sure that the moose directory is also cleaned/rebuilt
  clean: clean_avr
  clean_avr:
      @(cd moose; $(MAKE) clean)

FAQ

Q What does MOOSE stand for?
A Until the package fits the name, that's something from the past. Consider it
  just a name ;-)
